# GOT Network Analysis in R

## Objective:
A simple project on network analysis on the Game of thrones dataset using R. We look at the different centralities such as Degree, Closeness, Clustering, Betweenness centralities and come up with inferences and conclusions regarding who is the most influential and important character in GOT.

## Content:
* The Code.Rmd file contains the code used to get the network graphs for analysing ---> [Code](https://github.com/Dharineesh-Karthikeyan/Game-Of-Thrones-Network-Analysis/blob/main/Code.Rmd)
* The report pdf file contains the inferences and analysis of the network in detail ---> [Report](https://github.com/Dharineesh-Karthikeyan/Game-Of-Thrones-Network-Analysis/blob/main/Report.pdf)
* The dataset is in two files called union_edges and union_characters.

This blog was the main motivation and guideline which helped in working on this project. With the help of this blog, we tried to make more solid inferences that helped us to identify who had the most influence in the GOT franchise.
